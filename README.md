# R-quines

-------------------------------------------

Quines are pieces of computer code that can self-replicate or self-reproduce themselves. Signs of life are:

walking/movement
breathing
feelings/sensing
growing
replication
excretion
eating

This is a collection of R code that inputs "something something something" and outputs the same "something something something".
